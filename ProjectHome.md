# What Is Control? #

Control brings the wonders of touch-screen U.I. to your computer!
With Control your computer apps can put buttons, analog-sticks and more on your phone. They can even use the motion sensors. Importantly it's the apps that decide the layout. This means that the controller is easier to use because it has got everything there designed especially for the app.
Best of all it's no fuss. Just start up Control on your computer and connect with your phone!
And even if your favorite apps don't have their own Controllers you can still just use your phone as a mouse, remote or gaming controller.
